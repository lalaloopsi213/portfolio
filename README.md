<div class="header__text-box row">

        <h1 class="heading-primary">
        <!-- Replace the following name with your name -->
        <span>Lacey Foy</span>
        </h1>
        <!-- Put a small paragraph about yourself -->
        <p>A Web Developer based in Dallas, Tx.</p>
        <a href="#contact" class="btn btn--pink">Get in touch</a>
    </div>
</div>
```

Each div with class `work__box` represents a project, replace the contents of the all the tags with the information of your projects.

        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Parcel</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="work__links">
        <a href="#" class="link__text">
        Visit Site <span>&rarr;</span>

        </a>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="work__image-box">
